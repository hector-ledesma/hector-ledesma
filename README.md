## Hey there :grey_exclamation:
I'm Hector. That's it, that's the intro. 

:exclamation: Oh :exclamation: by the way, I ***REALLY*** like:
- :books: Studying. I'm constantly working through courses and learning resources on the things that I enjoy.
- :bar_chart: Data. The more I learn about programming, the more beautiful data becomes in my eyes. Catch me self-learning Machine Learning soon :wink:.
- :busts_in_silhouette: Rivalry. There's nothing more motivating than healthy competition.
