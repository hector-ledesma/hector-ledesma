## Hey there :grey_exclamation:
Thanks for checking out my github :exclamation:

Let me tell you a little bit about myself :
- :black_nib: I have a background in communications design (graphic design, marketing, advertising) and art :smile:. Thanks to this I'm able to better understand the user (from consumer to other developers) and how they will interact with a product and implement that onto all layers of the development process.
- :books: I really enjoy Studying. I won't lie to you, I struggle with consuming books effectively but my goodness are audiobooks and courses a blessing. From self-taught concept artist, to self-taught Java developer. I like to think I'm fairly autodidactic :wink:
- :bar_chart: Data. The more I learn about programming, the more beautiful data becomes in my eyes. I recently discovered the Data Engineer profession. Self-taught Data Engineer here I come!
- :running: I am ready to start! Do you have a project I could help with that would expose me to the technologies and processes that would help me develop into my career? Do you have any critiques towards any of my projects? Reach out!
